"article_content": "AprÃ¨s avoir essuyÃ© un sÃ©rieux revers en Afghanistan oÃ¹ les talibans sont revenus en force au pouvoir lâan dernier, Joe Biden tente maintenant de se racheter Ã  quelques mois des Ã©lections de mi-mandat en jouant Ã  fond la carte ukrainienne. En chute libre dans les sondages, il sait pertinemment nâavoir pas droit Ã  lâerreur car la capitulation de lâUkraine signifierait non seulement la dÃ©faite des Occidentaux, de lâOTAN mais Ã©galement un Ã©chec sur le plan personnel qui, du coup, tuerait dans lâÅuf toute vellÃ©itÃ© dâune reconduction en 2024. Ainsi, sur la proposition de la Maison-Blanche, des dizaines de milliards de dollars dâaide ont Ã©tÃ© votÃ©es au CongrÃ¨s pour permettre Ã  lâUkraine de renverser la vapeur sur le terrain.Or, alors quâun pays est en train dâÃªtre dÃ©vastÃ©, dÃ©chirÃ©, que des millions de vies sont bouleversÃ©s, brisÃ©s et des dizaines de milliers dâautres anÃ©anties, le bon sens aurait exigÃ© un cessez-le-feu immÃ©diat et non lâalimentation du conflit. MÃªme les nÃ©gociations entre les deux belligÃ©rants ont cessÃ©, Kiev ayant probablement obtenu des Occidentaux lâassurance dâune victoire. Certes, lâUkraine peut gagner mais la Russie nâacceptera certainement pas de perdreÂ ; Moscou ayant mÃªme multipliÃ© ces derniers temps la menace dâune Â« troisiÃ¨meÂ guerre mondialeÂ Â», voire dâune Â«Â frappe nuclÃ©aireÂ si les circonstances lâexigentÂ Â». Bref, le monde se retrouve ces jours-ci face Ã  un inextricable dÃ©dale qui pourrait tourner en une Ã©pouvantable guerre dâusure.Il va sans dire que lâobjectif initial de la Russie Ã©tait Ã©videmment de prendre le contrÃ´le de toute lâUkraine et chasser du pouvoir le prÃ©sident Zelensky, qualifiÃ© par le Kremlin de nÃ©o-nazi, ce que ce dernier rÃ©fute en brandissant ses origines juives. Et nombreux sont ceux qui croyaient que Moscou Ã©tait vraiment capable dâaccomplir cet objectif en quelques jours ou semaines car la force militaire russe, hÃ©ritiÃ¨re de lâarmÃ©e rouge de lâex-URSS, est perÃ§ue comme la seconde plus puissante au monde aprÃ¨s celle des Ãtats-Unis. Dâailleurs, Vladimir Poutine avait comme intention de complÃ©ter sa mission avant le 9 mai, jour-anniversaire de la victoire lorsque lâAllemagne nazie sâÃ©tait rendue aux forces soviÃ©tiques en 1945 Ã  Berlin. Comme quoi, le choix de la date du 24 fÃ©vrier pour le dÃ©but des opÃ©rations nâa pas Ã©tÃ© le fruit du hasard.Mais lÃ  oÃ¹ le Kremlin a pÃ©chÃ© par imprÃ©voyance, câest en nÃ©gligeant totalement lâÃ©ventualitÃ© dâune entrÃ©e en scÃ¨ne de lâOTAN sans pour autant Ãªtre prÃ©sent physiquement sur le terrain, ce pour ne pas dÃ©roger Ã  lâArticle 5 du TraitÃ©. En effet, la rÃ©sistance et la combativitÃ© des Ukrainiens combinÃ©es Ã  un systÃ¨me de renseignement performant et lâutilisation dâarmes efficaces ont complÃ¨tement pris les Russes au dÃ©pourvu, les contraignant de changer de stratÃ©gie en se repliant sur le Donbass Ã  lâest. LâOccident a, en effet, fourni Ã  Kiev du matÃ©riel militaire spÃ©cifique quâexigent les circonstances, dont des missiles antichars lÃ©gers et portables contre les blindÃ©s russes de mÃªme que des missiles Stinger, tirÃ©s Ã  lâÃ©paule, permettant dâabattre des hÃ©licoptÃ¨res de combat. En outre, quasiment en temps rÃ©el, les AmÃ©ricains dÃ©livrent au commandement ukrainien des renseignements sur lâemplacement et le degrÃ© de vulnÃ©rabilitÃ© des lignes dâapprovisionnement russes, permettant ainsi Ã  Kiev de rÃ©orienter, si besoin est, ses opÃ©rations sur le terrain. Cependant, quelle que soit lâissue de ce conflit, il est hautement improbable que lâUkraine puisse rÃ©cupÃ©rer la totalitÃ© de ses territoires, notamment le Donbass et la CrimÃ©e, perdus en 2014 et servant de zone tampon par la Russie contre les forces externes.Par ailleurs, Ã  ce moment prÃ©cis de la guerre, dans le but manifeste dâamplifier la provocation Ã  lâÃ©gard de Moscou, aprÃ¨s 75 ans de non-alignement, la Finlande, Ãtat qui compte plus de 1300 km de frontiÃ¨re avec la Russie, de mÃªme que la SuÃ¨de, ont signifiÃ© leur intention dâintÃ©grer lâOTAN, ce qui ne ferait quâintensifier davantage la tension existante dans la rÃ©gion de la mer Baltique de mÃªme que la mer de Nord. Mais quoi quâil en soit, la question fondamentale que lâon se poseÂ : pourquoi cet acharnement pathologique de la part des Occidentaux Ã  vouloir, Ã  tout prix, isoler la Russie alors quâun rapprochement entre Moscou et lâOTAN de mÃªme que lâUE aurait permis dâassainir considÃ©rablement les relations internationales et ce, pour le bien-Ãªtre de lâhumanitÃ© dans son ensembleÂ ?Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â "

"article_content": "SHYAMAPARSAD BISNAUTHSINGOn two occasions recently, the Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth stressed on the importance of concentrating our efforts in reaching self-sufficiency in as far as food crops vegetables and fruits are concerned. The question that needs to be answered is whether these sincere messages are catching the attention of those concerned players in contributing successfully to meet the goals.Mention is also being made that Covid-19 has impacted our present economic status as well as our social conditions. It is also an undisputed fact that the marketplace is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of thousands of small holder agro producers in Mauritius. Government support to Agriculture is generally in decline notwithstanding the fact that the Covid Solidarity Fund is an emanation of contributions from the whole population. Nevertheless, it needs to be agreed that every single cent invested by government is meant for economic development and the boosting up of revenues to the Exchequer.With the already dire times being faced and the uncertainties looming ahead, farmers will have to fight many challenges to get the ball rolling in providing an adequate supply of vegetables and fruits. Since they are great risk-takers and dependent on farming for their livelihood or for rounding up the family budget, they will surely show their resilience and fight back but with many difficulties.Dynamic need-based processIn this struggle, the handholding and accompanying measures of the technical and extension services will definitely be of paramount importance. Extension is basically a communication exercise and also a dynamic need-based process. It cannot remain static and be dependent on the budget and the will of those serving the purpose. Officers need to be visibly present in the fields of the farmers and also in the backyard projects of non-farmers. Moreover, those showing interest in food crop production should definitely be considered and encouraged to become entrepreneurs for transformation projects. As such, a good need-based program for them is of utmost importance.Officers need not be confined to the office as they ought to be in the fields along with the farmers, and never alone except in exceptional circumstances.Agricultural Projects and Policy Analysis UnitAs part of their duties as Development Officers of Ministry of Agro Industry and Food Security, they carry out regular/daily field visits in different localities under their respective jurisdictions and during each visit they meet around 8 to 10 planters or livestock keepers. As such, they are a store house of useful available data of the areas under their jurisdiction and a blueprint for a development program can easily be worked out for the scope and prospects for development of the farming potential of the country. Here FAREI can use ICT and other proven Communication Exercises, to provide real time information to farmers so that the latter can better plan their activities and choice of crops.It is unfortunate to note that till date very little Information Technology is being applied for the day-to-day farming activities. The website of FAREI is well designed but it is not farmer friendly as it is not accessible to the average farmer. Information dissemination could be channeled through a call center for more effectiveness as it would avoid displacements unless in exceptional circumstances. The data which has been collected by Extension Officers and Research Scientists on the field could be regularly fed to a data center for effective use in program planning. As such, the actual field situation and the required shortcomings could be addressed and actions would be known by the organisation at no additional or extra costs.The data collected, which would be very useful in all future planning and forecasting exercises, is the very foundation of a strong economy. In case of lacking, faulty or inconsistent data and time consuming data-processing, one does not stand any chance.Â  In this way, unlike what is being hammered regularly, it is the present and not the past that determines the future one wants; consequently, the volume of substantial data from the planters that include plantersâ and planting situations, field conditions and substantial budgetary data allocations from the Organisation or Government will be essential in chalking the way forward and thankfully, FAREI is in possession of both. Here the expertise and involvement of the Agricultural Projects and Policy Analysis Unit (APPAU) of the Ministry would be of prime importance.Accordingly, interesting schemes, after analysis of the field and market data, could be worked out to create a win-win situation as it was in the eighties when the country was self-sufficient in potatoes and producing and marketing dry maize cobs amongst others. It is time to create situations when farmers could be more easily linked to vertical markets in the supply chain.Since many years, the AREU â now FAREI â had taken as mission to explore every economic potential of each crop grown in Mauritius through the various possibilities of transformation and minimal processing. With the technical support under the NPIP project and Food Security Fund, attempts were made and the initiatives did bear fruits. Aggressive training programs were launched and sensitisation campaigns were undertaken. Many budding entrepreneurs were initiated and many have set up successful business in pickling and other food processing sectors at medium and micro level. As such, a store house of opportunities exists and those are unfortunately not tapped by farmers and farmer organisations.The Training Division is performing in a lackluster manner. Technology Development and other farmer development meetings are becoming a rare commodity. Farming News, which was a monthly mouth piece of Extension Division, is obsolete.Unfortunately during the last years, a letdown in the Agro Industry and Food Security segments had been noted and acknowledged publicly even by the Prime Minister. The causes and effects are right there and it is not a herculean task to finetune and work out remedial actions. The Ministry has the capacity required; it just needs thinking out of the box, analyze and bring out the remedial factors and harness all necessary efforts to implement those.Research and Development InstituteWe need a strong and proactive Research and Development Institute that would meet the aspirations of its clients in putting up a system wherein the aspirations of its clients (vegetables, fruits and livestock producers) are met. To achieve this, a thorough study and understanding of all the existing situational elements, which should be available by now from the frontline Extension Officers and their supervisors out of their daily field visits wherein they have met, observed and assisted farmers by tendering advice to their problems and other related issues. Adequate resources and funds should be budgeted and provided forâ¦ and this is the challenge for the CEO, especially during these days of economic difficulties! All technical and support staff including all mid-management personnel along with APPAU need to be taken on board in formulating and monitoring mechanisms and procedures for effective project implementation and treating farming as a business activity with the applications of all the related scientific disciplines including post-harvest technologies and notÂ  merely an occupation.Year in, year out, plantations and farms suffer from the vagaries of climate causing a situation of irregular supply of fresh vegetables and if ever those are available, they are automatically offered at rates that not everybody can afford and as every time the farmers fall back for compensations from government. This has become so recurrent and solutions to the problem need to be worked out.Major actions are urgently needed to find out whether we are adopting the right approach for food production. Whether inputs like quality planting materials, soil health enhancers and also whether farmers are operating in the right environment by acting individually or group themselves into corporates (companies), to benefit from the economies of scales and break away from the âtiplanterâ economy with the support of Government. Around the world there is a paradigm shift. This process might be the solution in creating a new generation of farmers and create the appropriate environment to reach self-sufficiency and ensure a Food Security condition for Mauritius and also be known as a food-exporting nation."

"article_content": "âIn the soil of fear are planted the seeds of deceptionâÂ [Mark Jenkins]IVANN BIBINouveau Front PolitikIn 2016 polls and surveys aimed at predicting the outcome of the US Presidential elections proved to be highly flawed, and off the mark: most predicting a comfortable win for Hillary Clinton. One theory to explain these modeling errors is known as the âTrump Effectâ, ââ¦.the so-called âshy Trumpâ effect. The idea is that Trump supporters took part in the surveys but were embarrassed to divulge their support for an unpopular candidate. If true, the âundecidedâ voters were really Trump voters all along; they just didnât want to admit it to pollstersâ¦âUnder the âTrump Effectâ candidate Trumpâs perceived fascist, and at times racist, anti-democratic rhetoric and behavior made people âshyâ to admit that they were going to vote for him, thereby skewing the surveys results with reality. In short, people lied when surveyed.Â Â  Today we may see the exact same scenario playing out in political surveys in Mauritius: even more so as it is two-fold. On the one hand, people are âshyâ to admit that they will vote (again) for the so-called âdinosaursâ or even for the former Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam; on the other hand, a systematically and deeply terrorized population, Lepep Morisien, are not only âshyâ but SCARED to admit that they WILL NOT vote for the current MSM regime and its leader Pravind Kumar Jugnauth. Fear dictates this. They are frightened, and extremely weary, of the age-old practice in Mauritius known as âreprÃ©sailles,â a tactic that the current Machiavellian Government has now taken to new heights and to new extremes.The examples of the ârevengeâ politics practiced by the MSM are many and the list is long, very very long. For the past seven years that the MSM has been in power these tactics range from massive scandals that have rocked the country such as the âBAIâ and âBetamaxâ fiascos, but also to more seemingly mundane events: such as the investigation of civil servants who may have leaked corrupt and fraudulent activities at the Ministry of Health.Who can forget the raiding of the Health Ministryâs offices and the seizing of computers in an effort to find the culprits of the leaks, instead of arresting the fraudsters of the alleged criminal activities themselves? In reality, events such as these are not mundane at all, and have a real impact on peopleâs lives and their psychology when it comes to their relationship with those who govern them. Worse, these types of events are innumerable, or business as usual, today in the Mauritius of the MSM. They permeate society, persecuting the population, rendering them paranoid, oppressed, and scared.Â Â  I witnessed this tragic and heartbreaking psychology, in an up-close and personal manner, during the 2017 by-election in Belle-Rose/Quatre-Bornes (#18), Mauritius.Â  While campaigning door-to-door in the constituency, I would come across many voters who consistently explained to me that they would NOT be voting in the upcoming by-election, simply because the Government (the MSM) had no candidate aligned. When pressed as to why this mattered, the response was literally always the same: because since the MSM/Government had not aligned a candidate, it automatically meant that any voter who cast a vote did not vote for the Government/MSM, and that this could have future ârepercussionsâ for the said voters and their families. I was shocked and heartbroken, as I was told more times than I care to recall: âMo frer travay la polisâ or âMo tifi travay dan lopitalâ or âMo kouzinn anseignant dan lekolâ or âMo bizin renouvle permit pou mo biznes.âThe People were, in my opinion, beyond oppressed: for me, this was tyranny.Upon closer analysis and by way of all the many answers from voters as to why they were abstaining in the 2017 by-election, two things became very clear to me long ago and beyond the shadow of a doubt: that across the board, the Mauritian population was petrified of its Government; and, that Mauritius was not a true democracy, not even close.Â Â  Can you picture for one moment what the results on a similar survey about political parties and political leaders might look like in North Koreaâfor example, how do you think the North Korean population might answer to a survey question such as âWould you vote to replace Kim Jong-un?â Before you answer that question, first answer this: what do you think would happen to all those North Korean voters who answered âYes, I would vote to replace Kim Jong-unâ in a survey?Most likely Kim Jong-un would bulldoze their houses and build a âtramwayâ where they used to live: all the while proclaiming to the Nation that it was in fact a âmetro.â And none would dare say otherwise.Â Â  Whilst Mauritius is no North Korea (yet), the psychology of their respective populations is similarâespecially when it comes to expressing any sort of anti-governmental sentiment, perceived or otherwise. Much like the âTrump Effectâ witnessed in the US, in Mauritius it is the âreprÃ©sailles effectâ that skews surveys drastically from reality. Hence, surveys that claim to reflect such statistics are in my opinion therefore evidently fundamentally flawed. Or as our Right Honorable Prime Minister might say âevidamanâ…"

"article_content": "MOOMTAZ EMRITH(Windsor, ON, Canada)Dr. âBabasahebâ Bhim Rao Ambedkar (1891-1956) was an eminent Indian polymath â a prominent jurist, economist and Dalit leader. He was also a politician and Indiaâs first Minister of Law and Justice in the first cabinet of Pt. Jawaharlall Nehru. As such, he headed the Committee that drafted the new Constitution of Independent India in 1947.Dr. Ambedkar, who was born in a Dalit home to Dalit parents in India, would rise up to shake up the whole hated caste system by virtue of his exceptional intellectual abilities and talents. He wanted the members of the higher castes in Indiaâs society to give to the Dalits their dignity as humans in the greater society. Indeed, Dr. Ambedkar would become a beacon, a crusader for âthe rights of the downtrodden.Â  According to the Hindu âcaste system,â society is divided in four divisions of labour, namely: (i) the Brahmins that generally comprise the Vedic scholars, priests and teachers; (ii) the Kshatriyas consist of the rulers, warriors and administrators; (iii) the Vaishyas grouping the farmers, merchants and traders, and (iv) the Sudras or the lowest class — the âUntouchablesâ or Dalits, as they are called — include the labourers, service providers and servants. Hard work and\nintellectual prowessAt first glance, the caste system socially looked all right but over the years, the system, as applied in society, came to be unscrupulously abused by âvested interest groupsâ to their own advantage so as to continue to enjoy their privileges. Once, you were born in a caste, you are in it for life despite whatever fame or glory you may acquire through your hard work and intellectual prowess. In other words, your caste follows you and your family throughoutÂ  your generations.Dr. Ambedkarâs case is one classic example of one who, despite being born in a Dalit family, and despite the fact that he rose, thanks to his fabulously gifted intellectual talents and hard work, to be one of the top intellectuals of his generation, yet, to the general Indian public, he remained a Dalit and, as such, suffered the prejudices, humiliation and taunts reserved to those of his caste. No wonder fighting the bane of âuntouchabilityâ and injustices became the prime motive of his adult life.Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar would thus rise from his humble Dalit origins, to earn unprecedented educational degrees from the Universities of Bombay, Columbia (US) and London School of Economics and even earned two PhDs as well as a law degree from Grayâs Inn of London. Later, as a political activist, he would become a member of Indiaâs Constituent Assembly and, as such, he would be picked by Prime Minister, Pt. Jawaharlall Nehru, to be the first Minister of Law and Justice of independent India.He was DalitDr. Ambedkar was an icon for human rights like no other. Yet, he suffered terrible humiliations — through no fault of his — because of the unfortunate circumstance of his birth. As a child or even as an adult, he would suffer humiliations, insults and taunts by detractors from the upper caste members because they knew he was from the low caste. So much so, it did not take him long to realize what âdignityâ and âself–respectâ meant. However, with his strong and undaunted character, he was never one to give in because of his low birth status. If he was Dalit, it was through no âfaultâ of his. He would take the insults and humiliations in stride and ever stand his ground and forcibly pursue his fight for justice, freedom and equal privileges for the downtrodden. So much so, he, who, as a child, could not âenterâ a classroom because of his caste, would be called âto write the Constitution of his homeland, India.âBeing born a Hindu, Dr. Ambedkar had learned and experienced some shackles personally the hard way. Years later, he would write: âI like the religion that teaches liberty, equality and fraternity.âHe, understandably, became a champion of freedom, of equal opportunities and free education for all. Education, he strongly advocated, was the gateway to progress in life and the way out of poverty and humiliation. Indeed, these will become the guiding light of his philosophy and the driving force behind his intellectual and professional striving.Dr. Bhim Rao Ramji Ambedkar was born in April 14, 1891, and he died in December 16, 1956, in Delhi. By the time of his demise, he had left Hinduism, the religion of his birth and converted to Buddhism. It is said that on the day, he chose to embrace Buddhism, a whole retinue of his followers â some say thousands of fellow Dalits — imitated his example and also converted to the religion preached by Gautama — the Buddha.Also, it is interesting to mention here that Dr. Ambedkar, after returning to India after completing his studies in London, England, went to the State of Baroda, which had awarded him the fellowship for higher studies in U.K., to take his first job. However, he could not find accommodation in a hotel in Baroda because of his caste. He therefore tried to get a room in a Parsi hotel but he was denied a room because he was no Parsi. However, he somehow talked the Hotel Manager into accepting him under a Parsi name. He did get a room but it would not be long before the subterfuge would be discovered and a group of Parsi, armed with sticks and placards demonstrated bo l, demanding his immediate removal. Dr. Ambedkar had no choice but to vacate the hotel and return to Bombay and find another work.New social and\npolitical horizonsIt is also interesting to add that when Ambedkar began his first job as a new senior officer, the peon (office attendant), would not hand him files in his hand but would throw them on his desk. And when he felt thirsty and asked for a glass of water, the peon would tell him there was no water. However, when he would go to drink from the pot, the upper caste workers found that uncomfortable and insulted him and would not permit him to drink from the pot because if he did, he would âpollute the waterâ. So, he was told to bring his own water. Â  Â Dr. Ambedkar on his return to Bombay got a job as Professor of âpolitical economyâ at Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics. Sure, it was a known fact by then that he was a Dalit and, understandably, on his very first day on the job, he was made fun of as âan untouchableâ. But despite the taunts, Dr. Ambedkarâs career would begin to take shape. He would make acquaintances that would open new social and political horizons for him. He would begin a newspaper called âMook-Nayakâ in 1920 and, around the same time, began to take part in public Lectures and Conferences.Â  It was in Mangaon, Kolhapur, that he met the Maharaja of Kolhapur, who was so impressed with Dr. Ambedkarâs personality and talent that he made a statement that would later prove to be true about him.Speaking of Dr. Ambedkarâs campaign for the underprivileged, he said, in reference to the rights of the struggling Indian masses: âYou have found your saviour in (Dr.) Ambedkar and I am confident that he will break your shackles.âDr. Ambedkarâs intellectuality would lead him to teach Economics as a university Professor and practice as a lawyer, and rise as a leader and political activist. As such, he would become a leading player in the campaign and negotiations for the freedom of India from the British. He played a meaningful role, along with such stalwarts like Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Pt. Jawaharlall Nehru and others for the Independence of India and would contribute significantly with his ideas and articles in journals and magazines. He was ever the champion of the underprivileged. Â  Â Dr Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar may have been born in a Dalitâs home but his life story is one shining example of success based on dedication and perseverance. We are not what we are because of our birth but we become who we are by our deeds, thus inspiring others to fight injustices and always strive to get ahead in life. Our greatness lies not in what we inherit but in whatever we achieve through our own ceaseless effort. In that line, Dr. Ambedkarâs life story is one heck of an example for anyone to emulate!Constitution DayToday, in India, Dr. Ambedkarâs name is honoured and venerated as a few other fellow Indians. He is definitely reckoned as a mahapurush (great soul) and revered and adulated. There are life-size statues of him all over the country and dozens of cultural and social institutions named after him while his birthday — Ambedkar Jayanti — on April 16th —Â  is now a national holiday and, for his role in the drafting of the new Constitution of India in 1947, he is celebrated at public events every year on CONSTITUTION DAY on November 26. These are no small feats for one who, because of his birth status, was, early in his life, derided and shunned like an âoutcast.â However, nowadays, Dr. Ambedkar is revered and venerated by his admirers like a âgod.âÂ  His fellow Dalits profess with pride and glee, their admiration for this great man who gave them dignity and respect. They affirm their gratitude for what he did for them as a social group in Indian society with this unambiguous tribute:Â  âWe are â¦ because he was!âDr. Bhim Rao Ramji Ambedkar! Here was a man!Â  Arenât we tempted to join the bard of Avon and shout out loud: âWhen comes such another!â…CAPTIONDr. Bhim Rao Ramji Ambedkar (1895-1956), is also affectionately known as âBabasahebâ â Photo: (Courtesy: Google:Pinterest) Â  Â "

"article_content": "DR JIMMY HARMONÂ« Les musÃ©es ont le pouvoir de transformer le monde qui nous entoure Â». Câest ce que le Conseil international des musÃ©es (ICOM) nous dit pour le choix de son thÃ¨me 2022 : Â« The power of museums/Le pouvoir des musÃ©es Â». LâICOM a dÃ©crÃ©tÃ© le 18 mai JournÃ©e internationale des musÃ©es et ce, depuis 1977, pour sensibiliser le public au rÃ´le des musÃ©es dans le dÃ©veloppement de la sociÃ©tÃ©. Une dÃ©lÃ©gation du MusÃ©e intercontinental de lâEsclavage Ã©tait en France sur invitation du ministÃ¨re franÃ§ais de la Culture et la Fondation pour la MÃ©moire de lâEsclavage (FME) dans le cadre dâun sÃ©jour dâÃ©change dâexpertises culturelles Ã  Paris, puis Ã  Bordeaux du 9 au 13 mai 2022. Cette mission a Ã©tÃ© rendue possible grÃ¢ce au soutien de lâAmbassade de France / Campus France. En tant queÂ  responsable du ISM Research & Events Sub-Committee, je faisais partie de la dÃ©lÃ©gation avec le prÃ©sident du Conseil dâAdministration du MusÃ©e intercontinental de lâEsclavage, Jean Maxy Simonet, et la coordinatrice technique MÃ©lissa Guillaume-Juliette. Fort des retombÃ©es de ladite mission et en lien avec la thÃ©matique Â« Pouvoir des MusÃ©es Â», je me permets dâapporter de nouveaux Ã©lÃ©ments dans la rÃ©flexion pour le MusÃ©e Intercontinental de lâEsclavage dont lâÃ©laboration avance Ã  grands pas avec le soutien de lâÃtat mauricien.La Ruse de LâHistoireÂ« La ruse de lâhistoire Â» est un terme utilisÃ© dans Â« Faire musÃ©e dâune histoire commune, rapport de prÃ©figuration de la nouvelle exposition permanente du musÃ©e national de lâhistoire de lâimmigration Â» (Ed. Seuil, 2019), publiÃ©e sous la direction de Romain Bertrand et Patrick Boucheron. De quelle ruse sâagit-il ? Au fait, le MusÃ©e a Ã©tÃ© installÃ© dans le pavillon amiral de lâExposition coloniale de 1931. Cette exposition dÃ©crivait nÃ©gativement les peuples colonisÃ©s et vantait la mission civilisatrice. Aujourdâhui, ce lieu affronte lâhistoire et amÃ¨ne les regards sur Â« la chambre noire de lâhistoire coloniale Â». Les collaborateurs Ã  ce projet Ã©crivent que Â« cette histoire ne peut Ãªtre que mondiale par vocation et comparatiste par mÃ©thode Â». Tout de suite, nous pouvons voir les similitudes avec le projet du musÃ©e de lâEsclavage Ã  Maurice. La Â« ruse de lâhistoire Â» dans notre cas a Ã©tÃ© le choix dâun ancien hÃ´pital militaire sous colonisation franÃ§aise. De tels hÃ´pitaux ont aussi existÃ© dans dâautres colonies. Les jeunes, les adultes, les femmes et les enfants mis en esclavage Ã©taient soignÃ©s dans ce lieu pas par souci de leur santÃ© mais pour ne pas contaminer la colonie et aussi pour garder leur valeur marchande dans le commerce des esclaves. Ce fut aussi le lieu oÃ¹ des marins, des armateurs, des propriÃ©taires des esclaves furent soignÃ©s. Donc, faire de ce lieu un musÃ©e de lâEsclavage aujourdâhui est une repossession des lieux.Tous les descendants des victimes et des agresseurs pourront affronter cette histoire. Le mot Â«Â affronterÂ Â» au lieu de Â«Â confronterÂ Â» dit bien que chacun a Ã  faire son chemin par rapport Ã  ce passÃ© douloureux tout en acceptant que lâesclavage a Ã©tÃ© un crime contre lâhumanitÃ©. Dans cette histoire douloureuse, la mÃ©moire a retenu des fragments du passÃ©. La mÃ©moire a retenu la figure de dÃ©fiance contre la dÃ©shumanisation.De Guadeloupe Ã  Maurice : Solitude, Anna de Bengale et autres Â« guÃ©rilleros de la libertÃ© Â». Le 10 mai, a Ã©tÃ© commÃ©morÃ©e la Â« JournÃ©e nationale des mÃ©moires de la traite, de lâesclavage et de leur abolition Â» depuis 2006 en France. La France est le premier Ãtat Ã  avoir dÃ©clarÃ© la traite nÃ©griÃ¨re et lâesclavage Â« crime contre lâhumanitÃ© Â». Lors de la 17e Ã©dition de la cÃ©rÃ©monie nationale franÃ§aise, une place spÃ©ciale fut donnÃ©e Ã  la mulÃ¢tresse Solitude (v.1772-1802). Lâexistence de Solitude est attestÃ©e par lâhistorien Auguste Lacour (1864-1945). En 1858, il Ã©voque sa prÃ©sence active aux cÃ´tÃ©s des rebelles menÃ©s par les officiers mÃ©tis et noir DelgrÃ¨s Ignace et Palerme, opposÃ©s au rÃ©tablissement de lâordre  colonial dÃ©cidÃ© en 1802 par Bonaparte. Les rÃ©cits populaires racontent quâelle rejoint une communautÃ© des Â« NÃ¨gres marrons Â» qui vivent libres, en marge de la sociÃ©tÃ© coloniale et câest avec eux quâelle combat le rÃ©tablissement de lâesclavage par NapolÃ©on Bonaparte, jusquâÃ  la mort. Elle est arrÃªtÃ©e alors quâelle est enceinte, et ne sera exÃ©cutÃ©e que plusieurs mois plus tard, au lendemain de son accouchement. Solitude pour les Antilles, Anna de Bengale et autres Â« guÃ©rilleros de la libertÃ© Â» pour Maurice, pour reprendre le terme utilisÃ© par le regrettÃ© AmÃ©dÃ©e Nagapen dont lâouvrage sur le marronnage demeure une rÃ©fÃ©rence incontournable. De telles figures, symboles de toutes les Â« fanm doubout Â» (Â« femme debout Â» crÃ©ole des Antilles), doivent trouver leur place dans notre musÃ©e de lâesclavage Ã  Maurice.La responsabilitÃ©â¨de la parole\nLe philosophe Mudimbe dans son Åuvre monumentale The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (1988) fait ressortir que nos institutions (Ã©coles, universitÃ©s, les diplÃ´mes octroyÃ©s) sont restÃ©es dans la Â«Â bibliothÃ¨que colonialeÂ Â». Nous sommes marquÃ©s inconsciemment par les sÃ©quelles de la colonisation. Il y a tout un travail de dÃ©construction Ã  faire. Câest lÃ  quâil incombe une responsabilitÃ© narrative Ã  ce que raconte le musÃ©e. Que raconte-t-onÂ ? Quel point de vueÂ ? Qui raconteÂ ? On sait que lâexpert ne connait pas tout et quâil nâest jamais neutre. Il est sujet Ã  lâempreinte dâun discours dominant. Câest lÃ  quâil est important de comprendre et de le faire comprendre que ce qui est racontÃ© dans un musÃ©e est appelÃ© Ã  Ã©voluer. Le musÃ©e a aujourdâhui une mission pÃ©dagogique. Au niveau international, on bouge vers le Â«Â musÃ©e conversationnelÂ Â». Il devient un espace de parole sur son passÃ©, le prÃ©sent et lâavenir. Câest un lieu oÃ¹ on coconstruit le rÃ©cit. On parle de plus en plus de Â«Â mÃ©diateur culturelÂ Â» qui entre en conversation avec les visiteurs au lieu du Â«Â guideÂ Â» traditionnel qui nâest quâun transmetteur dâinformations. Le mÃ©diateur culturel ou la mÃ©diatrice culturelle doit pouvoir entrer en dialogue et Ãªtre en empathie avec les visiteurs. Finalement, lâempathie pourrait bien Ãªtre le pouvoir des musÃ©es."
